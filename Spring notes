the default scope of a bean is singleton
	Singleton = spring creates on intsance of the bean

other scopes of bean = 
	prototype  = creates a new bean instance for each container request
	request = scoped to HTTP web request
	session =  scoped to HTTP web session
	glocal-session = scoped to global HTTP web session

on printing the bean out,it gives the name of the bean and its memory location

init-method ="" -> this helps to call any method during bean creation 
destroy-method = "" -> helps to call any method during bean destruction
	these  methos cannot have an any arguments and their return type cam be anything (noramlly void)

For "prototype" scoped beans, Spring does not call the destroy method. 

Java annotations are special label or markers added to Java class. They provide matadata about the class. They are processed at compile time or run time(for special processing).
	@override - eg of annotation, tells that the method is being implemented and class is overridden

	@component - used to give bean-id ( if left without a bean-id , if takes a default bean-id i.e. name of class in small)

we can do dependency injection using Annotations - > spring uses Auto-wiring
	Spring searches for a class that match a particular property , matches by class or interface and upon finding it, will automatically inject the dependency
	
Auto wiring has 3 types of injection -
	Constructor injection = we use constructor methods with autowired annotation
	Setter       ''		  = we use setter methods with  autowiredannotation
	Field        ''       = we use autowired annotation directly on the field [even private ones]       						(field = object of different class) and no need of constructor and setter 							methods. Uses technology called Java Reflection


We can inject any dependency using the @Autowired annotation using nay method (no tonly setter method)

If there are more than one dependency injections, then we use @Qualifier annotation to specify. We will give the default bean id of the class (i.e. class name with first letter lowercase)

To inject a properties file using java annotations , we use @Value annotation

To explicitly tell the scope of a bean , we use @Scope annotation

To perform tasks during bean construction and destruction , we use @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy annotations. These annotations can have any access modifier(public, protected or private) and return type and their methods cannot accept any arguments.

For "prototype" scoped beans, Spring does not call the @PreDestroy method. 

When we use Java Configuration Class , we do not need an xml file to configure beans. We make a java file and add @Configuration and @ComponentScan("package.name") and make a class of the same name

@PropertySource() annotation loads the file in the program 

----------------------------------------Spring MVC--------------------------------------------

Spring MVC is a framework for building web applications

In any servlet we make controllers to handle the job. Spring MVC creates another controller to handle these controllers , called the Front controller, also called as DispatcherServelet

M - Model objects (an object that stores the data)
V - view templates (a JSP page that will provide data to the user)
C - Controller classes  (performs all the business/functions)

JSP (JavaServer Pages) (similar to php but uses Java)

@Controller annotations say this is spring mvc controller and it inherits @Component annotation (used when making a controller class)

@RequestMapping("/") annotataion is used to choose which controller to send incoming requests. (it also handles all types of frequest)
	("/") -> shows the root controller 

Development process of Spring controller _
	create controller class
	define controller method
	add requstmapping to controller method 
	return view name
	develop view page

To access data from a POST/GET request , we use ${param.parameterName}

Model is a container for your application data. Controller puts data in the model and the view page (JSP) can access data from the model

To reaad form data in your controller code, we can pass in the HttpServletRequest in the controller method

to get a something form the HttpServletRequest, we use the method request.getParameter("parameterName")

to add attributes to the model, we use model.addAttribute("message",attribute)

To access data from the model , we use ${parameterName}

we use ${pageContext.request.contextPath} to access the correct root directory for your web application.
	Used to add images, css and js files 
		<img src="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/resources/images/spring-logo.png">

The Web Application Archive (WAR) file is a compressed version of your web application. It uses the zip file format but the file has the .war extension.
	we can deploy war files sperarately on Tomcat server by copying it to <tomcat-install-directory>\webapps

@RequestParam("parameterName") String Variable  => this annotation binds the value of parameter to the given varaible

if we add a requestmapping to the front controller then all the requestmappings to controller methods will be relative to it

Spring MVC form tags support data binding

we reference the tags by 
<%@ taglib prefix="form" uri ="http://www.springframework.org/tags/form" %>

Form tags :- 
	form:form - main form container
	form:input - test field
	form:textare - multi line text field
	form:checkbox - checkbox
	form:radiobutton - radio buttons
	form:select - drop down list

@ModelAttribute("student") Student theStudent => binds the value of attribute student to object theStudent

<%@ taglib uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core" prefix="c" %>
<!-- This tag helps us loop over the values. It references JSTL library   -->

We use Java's Standard Bean Validation Api to validate beans

Common Validation annotations :-
	@NotNull
	@Min 
	@Max
	@Size
	@Pattern = must match a regular expression
	@Future / @Past = date must be in future or past of given date

The Errors or BindingResult parameters have to follow the model object that is being
bound immediately 

@Valid performs the validation rules on Customer object
@BindingResult places the results of validation in theBindingResult 

@InitBinder annotations works as a pre-processor. It will pre-process each web request to our controller.

The root cause is the freePasses field is using a primitive type: int. In order to check for null we must use the appropriate wrapper class: Integer.

@interface annotation is used to create customs annotations in java
@Constraint annotation is used to specify the classes by which it will be validated
@Target annotation is used to specify where the annotation is applied (on a method or a field)
@Retention annotation is used 

------------------------------------------------------ Section 18 - Hibernate ---------------------------------------

Hibernate is a framework for persisting/ saving Java objects in a database. Hibernate takes care of all the low level SQL and minimises the amount of JDBC code you have to develop. It provdes the Object to Relational Mapping ORM

JDBC (java Database Connectivity) is an application programming interface for Java which defines how a client may access a database.

Hibernate uses JDBC to communicate to database. 

Entity class = a java class that is mapped to the database

Session factory reads the hibernate onfig file , created session objects. it is a heavy weight object, we only create it once in the project

Session is a wrapper around the JDBC connection to the database. the Main object used ot save/retrieve objects. It is short lived

@Entity and @Table(name="taable-name") annotations are used on the class method to map to the table of the class

@Id annotation tells that this field is primary key.
@Column(name="") maps to the column of the table in database

@GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.IDENTITY) = lets MySQl handle the generation Auto_Increment using the id annotation or identity column
									   .AUTO) = picks an appropriate strategy for the particular database
									   .SEQUENCE) =  assigns primary keys using a database sequence (Oracle DB2 uses sequences)
									   .TABLE) = assigns primary keys using an underlyng database table to ensure uniqueness

Fetch types - 
	Eager - will retrieve everything
	Lazy - will retrieve on request

to join two column via foreign key ,we use @OneToOne annotation and @JoinColumn(name="column-name") annotation

Cascade types - (what happens to the entity , will also happen to the related entity)
	Persist / Remove / Refresh / Detach / Merge / All - all the above cascade types

@OneToOne amnnotation has by default, no operations are cascaded, so to cascade , use @OneToOne(cascade=CascadeType.ALL)
(For single direction relationship)

for dual direction relationship, use @OneToOne(mappedBy="") , we can also add the cascadeType parameter in the annotation 
	mappedBy attribute is used to make the relation bidirectional, it points to the object of this class in other class and is accompanied by @JoinColumn(name="") in the other class pointing to his clas.

	@JoinColumn annotation finds the join column depending on the context, or depends on the type of relation, read --
		https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-hibernate-tutorial/learn/lecture/8164036#questions

Data is fetched in different ways - (only load data when absolutely needed)
	Eager - will retrieve everything
	Lazy - will retrieve on request

fetch=FetchType.LAZY  attribute makes the content load lazily (only loads the constructor and then laods other stuff on demand)

Default fetch types - 
	@OneToOne =  FetchType.EAGER
	@OneToMany = 		  .LAZY
	@ManyToMany = 		  .EAGER
	@ManyToMany = 		  .LAZY


To retrieve the data, you need to have an open hibernate session (connectivity to the database), or hibernate will throw an error

A join table is a table that provides a mapping between two tables. It has foreign keys for each table to define the mapping relationship 

@JoinTable annotation tells Hibernate about the Join table, and the two columns which use foreign keys to the other tables.
	@JoinTable(name="", joinColumns=@JoinColumn(name="first_column"),inverseJoinColumns=@JoinColumn(name="second_table"))


------------------------------------------------- CRUD project ----------------------------------------------------------

DAO - Data Access Object - its a helper class for interfacing with the database. Its needs the Hibernate session factory to communicate to the database.

the Hibernate Session Factory needs a DataSource that has the database connection info.

Enity class is basically a java class that is mapped to a database table

@Transactional annotation - automatically  begins and ends a transaction for your hibernate code. 

@Repository annotation - is used to register the DAO implementations. (comes under component scannning)

@GetMapping & @PostMapping annotations - to set the request type of form 

We add a service layer between the Main controller and the DAO, called the Service Layer. This layer can integrate data from multiple sources / DAOs

@Service annotation id applied to Service implementation (it also implements component scanning)

Whenever we link a different page in spring, we use href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/fileLocation/fileName"

--------------------------------------------------- AOP -----------------------------------------------------------

AOP stands for Aspect oriented programming. It encapsulates cross-cutting logic. it works behind the main lines and the project doesnt know about the AOP aspect/class.

AOP is used for logging, security , exception handling and api management

Aspect : module of code for a cross-cutting concern

Advice - What action is taken and when it should be stopped 

Join point - When to apply the code during program execution 

Pointcut - A predicate expression for where advice should be applied 

Weaving - connecting aspects to target objects to create an advised object. Different types of weaving - Complie-time, load-time or run time(slowest)

Run time waving - uses a AOP proxy between communicaton from Main app to Traget object.

AOP is used via Spring AOP or AspectJ.
	Spring AOP - only supports method level join points but run time code weaving is slower
	AspectJ - faster and supports all join points and weaving but code gets complex

@Transactional annotation uses AOP to start, commit and end the transactions

@enableAspectJAutoProxy annotation is for support of processing the Aspect classes

getClass() - method gives the class name for display

Pointcut Expression Language - 
	execution(modifiers-pattern? return-type-pattern declaring-type-pattern? method-name-pattern(param-pattern) throws-pattern?)
	? - means the pattern is optional 
	We can use wildcard (*) characters

param-pattern - 
	() - matches a method with no arguments 
	(*) - matches a method with one argument of any type
	(..) - matches a method with 0 or more arguments of any type


@Before("execution()") annotation is used to write poincut expression before the advices

@Pointcut("execution()") annotation is used for poincut declaration ie store the pointcut expression in a method (like a variable) and reuse it as much as u want.

We can combine pointcut experessions and perform AND(&&) , OR(||) and NOT(!) 

The order of advices( pointcut expressions) being applied to the same code is random(as default)
but we can control the order using @Order annotation and by placing the advices in separate aspects

@AfterReturning(pointcut="",returning="") annotaton is used to apply pointcut expression after the method has run. We can post process the data (when the data is output from the method just executed).
	returning parameter can help store the result of method in a variable

@AfterThrowing(pointcut="",throwing="") annotation applies the point cut expressions after the method throws an exception. The exception still happens and is displayed normally.

@Around() annotation applies before as well as after the method has executed and also could be used to handle the exception (also fix it).

@After() annotation applies the pointcut expressions after the method has completed irrespective of the output even if its an exception

PreceedingJoinPoint is a handle to the target method 

Spring prints to the Logger output Stream while Sopln prints to Standard output stream. we can use Logger class instead of Sopln to print to the Logger Output stream

----------------------------------------------- Maven -----------------------------------------------------

Maven is a project management tool. Use - build management and dependancies. Maven will find the needed JAR files and we dont have to use build path / class path and we have a standard directory structure.

POM file  - Project Object Model file - basically a configuration file / shopping list for all the needed dependancies

To add a dependancy , we need - Group Id, Artifact Id and Version (Optional) - These are known as GAV

Archetypes contain template files / starter files for a given maven project.

You can host your own private depandacies and repositories by hosting your own private maven server like nexus from sonatype and archiva from apache

---------------------------------------- Spring Security ------------------------------------------

Spring security is implemented using Servlet filters in the backgroud.

2 methods of securing a webapp : declarative and programmtic

Servlet filters are used to preprocess and post process web requests based on security logic 

Maven war plugin is used to tell that we will be suing all Java configuration and no XML 

@EnableWebMvc - provides similar support to <mvc:annotation-driven /> inm XML. Adds conversion, formatting and validation support.

Spring Security provides a class called Spring Security Web App Initializer. It is used to initialize the servlet container. it enables the Spring Security Filters.

Spring form tag - <form:form> - provides automatic support for spring security defenses

Spring security protects against Cross Site Request Forgeries (C-Surf)

http.authorizeRequests().antMatchers("/").hasRole("") - gives accese to the path to a selected roles 

<security:authorize access="hasRole('')"> tag lets you display stuff based on user role access

bcrypt algorithm = performs one way encrypted hasing, adds a random salt to the password for additional protection and incldes support to defeat brute force attacks 

---------------------------------------------- REST APIs and REST webservics------------------------------------------

REST - Representational State Transfer - Lighweight approach for communicating between applications

Data binding is the process of converting the JSON data into Java POJOs (Spring does it wit the help of Jackson)

AN HTTP request message has 3 parts - request line, header variables, message body.
	Request Line has the actual request method - GET / POST / PUT / etc
	Header variables has the request metadata and other info about message 

the response message also has the same data - repsonse line, header variables and message.
	Response line has the server protocol and status code - 404/200/403 etc
	header variables 

Status codes -  
	100-199 = Informational
	200-299 = Successfull
	300-399 = Redirection
	400-499 = Client error [ 401 - Authentication Required, 404 - File Not Found]
	500-599 = Server error [500 - Internal Server Error]

The message format is descibed by MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Entension) content type,

@RestController annotation - extension of @Controller and handles REST requests and responses

Path variables are used to fetch single entites from the data {parameterizing the rest api to get specific data}
	@PathVariable annotation is used to bind path variable to method parameter

@PostConstruct annotation is called only once when the bean is constructed. 
	This annotation is executed when the bean has initialized all the things and all the dependencies have been injected. 

@ExceptionHandler annotation is used to define exception handler methods. Exception Handleer will return a Response Entity.

Response Entity is a wrapper for the HTTP response object.

Jackson returns an empty body for a null input

@RequestBody annotation binds the POJO to a method parameter

@Configuration annotation - enables tp register extra beans with @Bean or import other configuration classes

@EnableAutoConfiguration Annotation - Enables Spring Boot's auto-configuration support

@SpringBootApplication annotation - enables Auto configuration ,Component scanning and Additional configuration
	Does the work of @EnableAutoConfiguration, @ComponentScan and @Configuration

Spring Boot Starters are a curated list of Maven Dependencies for making the development of Spring easier

Spring boot Dev Tools - auotmatically update the project and restart the server when some new code is added to the project

Spring Boot Actuator - exposes endpoints to monitor and manage your application. We get the Dev-OPs functionality out of the box. All the actuator endpoints are prefixed with /actuator. Some actuator endpoints are - 
	/health - Health info about your application
	/info - Info about your project 
	/auditevents - audit events for your application 
	/beans - List of all beans registered in the Spring application context
	/mappings - List of all @RequestMapping paths
	/threaddump - Lists all the threads running in our program

JPA - Java Persistence Api - is used for Object to Relatinal Mapping (ORM). EntityManager is part of JPA 
	EntityManger can serve as a wrapper for a Hibernate Session object. it is similar to Hibernate SessionFactory

Spring Data JPA helps to reduce the boiler plate DAO code like its implementatyion and other stuff. We just simply extend JpaRepository interface and plug in the entity type and primary key and Spring will give the CRUD implementation of it . 

Spring Data Rest helps to reduce the boiler plate rest code like its implementatyion and other stuff. We add the Spring data rest dependency in POM file, and simply extend JpaRepository interface and plug in the entity type and primary key and Spring will give the CRUD implementation of it .
	There is no need for Rest Controller and rest service 

Spring data rest endpoints are HATEOAS compliant 
	HATEOAS - Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (Hypermedia driven sites provide info to access REST interfaces). Its basically meta data for the Rest data
	HATEOAS uses HYpertext Application Language (HAL) data format

@RepositoryRestResource(path="") annotation - we can choose to name the endpoints accourding to our need

We can perform configuration, sorting, pagination using Spring Data Rest

------------------------------------- Thymeleaf -------------------------------------

Thymeleaf is a Java templating engine. Commonly used to generate the HTML views for web apps.
It is same as JSP but the key difference is JSP is only for web related uses but Thymeleaf is used for both web and non web related uses.
Thymeleaf files have .html extension.
