Notes-

Props (Properties) in RN are used to customize React Componenents. 
They cannot be changed once set, when the component is created.

RN uses React Navigation in order to navigate between different scenes/views of your app.

cmd =>npx react-native init <projectname>  => creates app
    add <--version> - for specific version of react native
    add <--template> - use a specific template for app
    add <--directory> - create a custom directory for app

cmd =>npx react-native start  => starts Metro, which bundles the app and starts development server
    instead we use AVD and start the device we created
    and run cmd =>npc react-native run-android
