Big data -> Better models -> Higher precision 

-- help with personalized marketing 
-- recommendation engines 
-- sentiment analysis
-- collective consumer behaviour 
-- personalized medicine 
-- disaster management -> predict the extend and impact

Sources 
-- machines 
-- people
-- organizations 

Machine generated data advantages 
-- culture shift to real time operations
-- supervisory control and data acquisition 

Data generated by people â€“ unstructured and  text-heavy

 data warehouses are central repositories of integrated data from one or more sources 
the data in warehouses is extracted from multiple sources and is transformed into a common structure form and it can slow down that into central database 

data integration process 
- discovering
- accessing
- monitoring
- modelling
- transforming

1) acquiring data 
identify suitable 
acquire all available 
- traditional databases -> sql 
- text files -> scripting languages
- remote data -> web services
- nosql storage -> api and web services


2-a) exploring data 
understand data -> trends outliers correlations 
describe data -> mean median mode range std deviation 
visualize data -> 


2-b) pre-processing data 
clean + transform 
- inconsistent data
- duplicate records -> merge 
- missing values -> remove 
-  invalid data -> generate best estimate 
- outliers -> remove

data munging / data wrangling/ data preprocessing 
- manipulation
- scaling
- dimension reduction
- transformation
- feature selction


3) analyzing
inpt data -> analysis technique -> model -> model op

categories 
- classification .. predict category 
- clustering .... organize similar in groups 
- regression .... predict numerical value 
- graph analytics .... to find connection between entities 
- association analysis ... fid rules to capture associations between items

modelling .... select technique -> build model -> validate model 

evaluation of results 
and what next steps 
- repeat
- dive deeper
- act



4) communicaing results
what oto presnt 
- what are main results
- how can model add to application 
- how do the results compare to the beginning pf project

visualization tools 


5) turning insights into actions
- implementation
- assess impact
- determine next steps
