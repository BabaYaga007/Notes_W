Every player gets 3 cards.

He is only to see the cards once before the game starts and remember them and their place

The goal is to amass maximum number of Aces (max 3).
In case of one or more players, end up with an equal number of Aces, the player with the lowest sum of cards wins. 

Throwing King lets you reveal any player's card (including yourself) discreetly, without changing their precedence.
Throwing Queen lets you shuffle any player's card including yurself discreetly.
Throwing Jack lets you swap any player's card with yourself discreetly.

No one can view their cards once the game start without throwing a King.

Two piles are there, one new-cards pile and other used-cards pile

The player picks one card from the new-cards pile, views it and if he wants to exchange the card 
with their current cards, they can swap and their card on to the garbage pile.
