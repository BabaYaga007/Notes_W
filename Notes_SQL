Aim = To learn more about SQL(And to complete the course and get the certificate)

Course Name  = Introduction to SQL

Course Specialization =  Web Applications for Everybody Specialization 

Medium = Coursera

Start date = June 4, 2019

-------------------------------------------Week 2 ------------------------------------------------

To open command line in mysql = 
	mysql -u root -p

Four Basic Operations in SQL(CRUD)
	Create/ Insert, Read/Select, Update, Delete

Terminolgy:-
	relation or tables 
	tuple or row
	attribute or column

The first row of the table is called metadata

DDL(Data Definition)
	Create

Data Manipulation Language
	insert
	select
	update
	delete

Limit clause limits the number of rows in a query (it gives the first n rows)

Count func gives count of rows
Distinct func gives the count of unique values in a column

% = wildcard character ( % before a character - anything ending with e)

like clause is used to de wildcard matching

CRUD = create, read , update , delete

VARCHAR = allocates space dynamically (depending on the size)
CHAR = allocates fixed space

Character Set =
	TINYTEXT = 255
	TEXT = 65K
	MEDIUMTEXT = 16M
	LONGTEXT = 4G

A latin character set (ASCII) is of 8 bits while a UNICODE character set can be upto 32 bits.

Binary Types =
	BYTE = 255 bytes 
	VARBINARy = 65K bytes

Binary Large Objects (BLOB) to store images, text documents, files , etc
	TINYBLOB = 255
	BLOB = 65K
	MEDIUMBLOB = 16M
	LONGBLOB = 4G

Floating point numbers
	FLOAT (32 bit) - seven digits of accuracy
	DOUBLE (64 bit) - 14 digits of accuracy

NOW() function gives the date at the time.

Two tupes of indexing =
	Hashing 
	B-Tree

---------------------------------------------------Week 3 -----------------------------------------

Data Normalization :-
	Do not replicate data (dont put the same string twice)
	Use integers as keys and refernce the data to be replicated (numbers can be replicated)

Foreign Key is the Primary Key of another table. It basically points to a row in another table.

Always make the smallest tables first (the tables which are independent ie that dont have foreign keys)
Work form the leaves of the tree to the root

Join operation links across several tables as a part of Select operation using the ON keyword.

ON DELETE CASCADE, ON UPDATE CASCADE = we are telling the databases that if there is a change in one table and the table is connected to another table via foreign key , then update the changes on that second table also.
	default/RESTRICT = dont allow changes that break the constraint
	CASCADE = adjust child rows by removing or updating to maintain consistency
	SET NULL = set the foreign keys columns in the child rows to null.

------------------------------------------------Week 4---------------------------------------------------

To handle many to many relationships in sql , we make a junction table in between and turn the many to many into two (many to one).
