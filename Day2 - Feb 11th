watch -n 1 date => command gives the real time in cmd and update very second

4 ways to install a OS -
	Baremetal = directly on the laptop 
	Virtualization = OS is installed on top of baremetal OS
	Dual booting = 
	Cloud Computing = 

Ctrl + C => terminates the program 
Ctrl + Z => it pauses the state of programs and puts it in the program

jobs => this command shows the jobs currently in the background

fg <program no./id> => starts the program from its paused state (programs in the background)

<program> & => puts the program in the background but the program is still in the running state 

echo "`date`" => will run the date command and the echo command simultanously, ie it will the print the date command in new line and then puts the controller in next line (echo)

echo -n "hello" => will put the controller in the same line as the output 

echo -e "hello\nhi" => will read the \n as new line character only if -e is written

escape sequences :- \b = for backspace. \n = new line , \t = tab

man <command> => shows the manual pages of the command

U can create a file with cmd commands in it and run the file using bash <filename> command . Thid type of file is called scripting file

command to output time on terminal with 1sec refresh rate and also we can still use the command
# while : 
> do 
> echo -n -e "`date +%T``sleep 1`\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b" 
> done & 

Today we learned about -
1= types of ways of installing an OS - Baremetal and Virtualization, also learnt about  Dual Booting and Cloud Computing
2= Learned about the difference between Ctrl + Z and Ctrl + C
3= learned usage of the commands - watch , jobs, fg, &(amp), man, echo  and also about some escape sequences
4= learned to create the command to output time on terminal with 1sec refresh rate and still be able to use the terminal
