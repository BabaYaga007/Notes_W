A class is like a template to make objects.

Objects/Instances are instances of the class. Instances are actual objects that are made at the runtime
The object consists of state and the behaviour that is defined in the object's class.

The set of values of the attributes of a particulr object is called a state.

Some of the code thats part of the object is called Method/ Functions

"new" keyword is used when making a new object of a class.

'time()' function gives current time in seconds from 01/01/1970 

' -> ' is used to call methods of an object (acces items in an object)

' nl2br("...\n") ' for printing new line

to access static items in a class, use ' :: '

we can make objects of empty class
