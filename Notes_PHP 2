A class is like a template to make objects.

Objects/Instances are instances of the class. Instances are actual objects that are made at the runtime
The object consists of state and the behaviour that is defined in the object's class.

The set of values of the attributes of a particulr object is called a state.

Some of the code thats part of the object is called Method/ Functions

"new" keyword is used when making a new object of a class.

'time()' function gives current time in seconds from 01/01/1970 

' -> ' is used to call methods of an object (acces items in an object)

' nl2br("...\n") ' for printing new line

to access static items in a class, use ' :: '

we can make objects of empty class

PDO 

GRANT ALL ON misc.* TO 'fred'@'localhost' INDENTIFIED BY 'zap';

put  this in a different file and include it everywhere
	$pdo = new PDO('mysql:host=localhost;port=3306;dbname=misc','fred','zap'); 
	[to make connection to databse]

	$pdo->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);  [to see the error listed on screen]

FETCH_ASSOC gives the rows back in an associative array

/prepare,execute statements are used when we have values to sustitute

PDO automatically takes cares of all the SQL injection queries ( if we use place holders)

error_log("file,SQL error=".$ex->getMessage()) method puts the error message in logs

to see the logs -> got to c:\xampp\php\logs\php_error_log

$_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] is used to refreash the page

Cookies are part of the HTTP protocol

Cookies are part of server data that is stored in the browsers.

Cookies are used to mark borwsers. When a server gets many requests from different browsers , it need to know which browser, a particular request came from , so it marks it using cookies.

cookie data ends in $_COOKIE (its a super global array)

Sessions are stored in servers and databases
