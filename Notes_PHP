php tag -- 
	<?php

	blah; 
	blah; 

	?>

=> the <pre> tag in html displays the text as it is written in the editor (with all the white places involved)

=> All variables start with a dollar $ sign.

=> to conatenate strings, we use "."

=> \n spans a new line

Strings can be shown by both single and double quotes

But \n dosent work in single quotes and also variables with dollar sign dont expand in single quotes.
( In single quotes variable are shown with dollar sign and vlaue is shown in double quotes)

you can concatenate a single quotes string and a double quotes string 

Comments : 
	single lne = //jfhkfhw , #akdjakldj
	Documenation = /*  rwrwofjw
	wkfjwlf */

Display statements :
	echo : can accept multiple parameters with braces
	print : can have only on parameter

we can add integers as ell as floating point numbers together
we can even add words to numbers and the value of names is 0

if boolean number is added to integer , true converts to 1 and false converts to nothing

 								ARRAYS

arrays can also have key-value pair and elements can also be indexed. 

map to operator (=>)

we can print tags using echo, eg
	echo(" <pre>");
	echo("</pre>");

we can print arrays using 
	print_r() -> it doesnt show print (used for debug printing)
	var_dump() -> it is more precise ( it can print false also) provide more info

we can create an empty array using $var = array();

looping in an array 
	foreach( $var as $key => $val) {
	}

count() gives the number of keys in array

explode("p", $arrray) = p is the parameter on which the string is split, and the parts 
are made elements of array.
