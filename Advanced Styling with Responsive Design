Notes=>
-----------------------------------------------Week 1----------------------------------------------------------

Responsive design means whether the site will look good on devices with diffrent screen sizes

Responsiveness can be employed using ----
	RWD (Responsive Web Design) = (Best), return the same page with little modifications,(return same code), same url
	Adaptive Web Design = return differnt versions of pages for different browsers,(different code), same url
	Separate Mobile Site(.m) = Separate page url for mobile site, different code and different urls

Pixels = they remain same across all devices and screens

em = sizes an element relative to its parent element

rem = sizes an element relative  to the HTML(root element) font size

ADVICE => Font Size Idea: % at the Root, rem for Components, em for Text Elements 

Absolute measurements = {
	px =(pixel) 1/96 of inch

	mm = millimeter
	cm = centimeter
	in = inch

	pt = (point) 1/72 of inch
	pc = (pica) 12 points
}
Relative measurements = {
	% = relative to font size (in pixels) of parent element

	em = { 1em = 16px = 12pt = 100%} 

	rem = 

	vw = (viewport width) 1/100 of width of viewport

	vh = (viewport height) 1/100 of height of viewport
}

----------------------------------------------Week 2-----------------------------------------------

Media queries consist of two elements - media type and query

implementing media queries
	to import media queries -
		@import url(stylesheet.css) screen and (min-width:600px)

	putting in style sheet
		@media screen and (min_width:500px){...}

	by linking
	<link rel="stylesheet" media= "screen and (min-width:400px)" and (orientation:potrait)>

<meta name = 'viewport' content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1'>

padding and margin is affected by width and not by height

In media queries, lways start with the smallest sizes first.

Doesnt allows the user to zoom in or zoom out on the page--
	<meta name = ‘viewport’ content=‘width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale = 1’>

-----------------------------------------------Week 3------------------------------------------------

Popular Frameworks = 
	Bootstrap 
	Foundation by ZURB
	Semantic UI
	Pure by Yahoo
	Ulkit by YOOtheme

container class
	.container has different widths for different types of devices.(gives 15px padding from both sides)
	.container-fluid expands to fit the width of the device.

Sizes --
	xs = extra small (480px)
	sm = small (768px)
	md = medium (992px)
	lg = large (1200px)

if we specify something for small, then it will be their for medium and large also .Only if we specify the size , then it will override the default.

Bootstrap code (needed)--
	<div class="container">
  		<div class="row">
    		<div class="col-xs-*">

------------------------------------------------Week 4---------------------------------------------

Classes in Bootstrap used for image responsiveness
	img-responsive
	img-rounded = gives border radius to imges to give them a curved look.
	img-circle = it cuts off the corners and oly shows a circular photo
	img-thumbnail

table classes --
	.table =
	.table-striped = 
	.table-bordered = 
	.table-hower =

table-responsive class at the parent div makes the table more responsive (gets a scroll at the bottom of the table)

element classes = 
	warning, active, danger, success, info


ADVICE = Always sketch the layout(wireframe) of your website first and then try to improve on it later.
