React is a way to make HTML components reusable.

every Compnonet has a render method wich contains the markup, it is the virtual dom 

React uses JSX - javascript with xml to render components 

React Redux is an application level store of data , without the need to have a database for some temporary store at the application level.

whenever we want to update anything in the state. we always do it using setState() method

When we crate a react js component, we can either create a function or a class.
	A function is always stateless, we cannot create states, we can only pass props(properties).
	In a class, we can access the state as well as the props.

In a class, we create a render method to return the components and a constructor to use the props

State is a property which is unique to a component, we initialize all state variables inside constructor

All the markup is showed in the render method

we export the app to make it accessible for other components

Synthetic methods are methods 

React events are named using camelCase

In JSX, we pass a function as the event handler rather than a string

If you have to stop the default behaviour of a method, we do not return false (as in HTML), we use e.preventDefault() function

There are two types of components - Functional (function based) and classic (class based)

Every function can return only one element (HACK - envelope everything in a div tag)

class attribute is written as className in react

whenever we want to send data from one component to other we use props (aka properties)

React Hooks

1) useState => The most basic react hook. It is used to manage state in functional components. It simplifies the state process by providing a 
		state variable along with a method to set that state.
		
2) useEffect => This hook is used in place of the component lifecycle methods in class components. It provides a way to optimize the number of 
		times a webpage has to re-render.
		
3) useRef => This hook is used to get reference to a DOM Element on a webpage which can then be manipulated.

4) useContext => Provides a simple way to use Global State Management using Context API.

5) useReducer => Provides a simple way to use Global State Management using Redux.

We can also create our own custom hooks to clean our code and provide high reusability.
